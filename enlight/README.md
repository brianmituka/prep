## why?
Enlight is a resource aimed at teaching anyone to code by building projects.

My name is Samay Shamdasani and I built enlight. Over the past year, I've been learning to code the web (mainly in JavaScript). At first, I ended up taking many courses and reading books learning about the language. However, I learned so many terms, objects, statements, etc. that I couldn't really implement them. Then, I started to make mini-projects by following tutorials online and scraping through code on GitHub. Here's my attempt at sharing my knowledge of these mini-projects so that you can develop your skills by actually creating something. On here, you'll find a variety of fun, useful, and interesting projects related to web development - and I hope you'll benefit from them.

Think we can work together? Shoot me an email. hi@shamdasani.org

<p class="enlight">Enlight is a <span class="underline">resource</span> aimed at <span class="underline">teaching</span> anyone to code by <span class="underline">building</span> projects.</p>
<p class="about">
My name is <a href="https://shamdasani.org" class="underline">Samay Shamdasani</a> and I built enlight. Over the past year, I've been learning to code the web (mainly in JavaScript). 
At first, I ended up taking many courses and reading books learning about the language. However, I learned so many terms, objects, statements, etc. that I couldn't really implement them. Then, I started to make mini-projects by following tutorials online and scraping through code on GitHub. Here's my attempt at sharing my knowledge of these mini-projects so that you can develop your skills by actually creating <i>something</i>. On here, you'll find a variety of fun, useful, and interesting projects related to web development - and I hope you'll benefit from them.

<p class="about">
If you're a beginner at web development, I strongly reccomend you to take a look at <a href="http://marksheet.io" class="underline">Marksheet</a>. It's a really informative tutorial on HTML and CSS. For starting with JS, you can jump right in with the projects - or you can browse through the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript" class="underline">codeacademy course</a>. It does a great job of going over the terminology and the uses of JavaScript. Those two are the best resources I used when I first learned to code. Oh, and Google - that's a big one :).
